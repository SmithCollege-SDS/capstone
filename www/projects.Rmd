## Current projects

We are currently seeking new sponsors for the Fall 2023 semester. Please see the [sponsors](sponsors.html) page for information about sponsoring a project, and the [project archive](projects.html#project_archive) for information about past projects.  

## Project archive


```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
gs4_auth("albert.ys.kim@gmail.com")
archive <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17nrW5cXHFeoISeNdU_DEYfb_t6i49lUv5Ie_mbIO6Zo/edit#gid=0")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
archive %>%
  arrange(desc(year), semester, client) %>%
  mutate(
    Term = paste(stringr::str_to_title(semester), year), 
    Title = ifelse(repo_public, paste0("[", title, "](", repo, ")"), title), 
    Sponsor = ifelse(client_public, paste0("[", client, "](", url, ")"), "[redacted]")
  ) %>%
  select(Term, Sponsor, Title, Students = students) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Previous capstone sponsors")
```
