They were able to work around the difficulties of not having all the resources they had at the beginning due to the pandemic. They found creative solutions to problems involving datasets that we too large to handle in a conventional way, and worked with tools that are familiar to our team at the Met Council. The team maintained a positive attitude during the development of the work, asked reasonable questions, and tried to clarify the tasks along the way. As a result, they produced something that is of significant value for the development of our greenhouse gas mitigation research at the Metropolitan Council.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\nEBSCO logo\n\n\n\n\nKayleigh Hinckley\n‚ÄúThe students from SDS 410 were great to work with.

We look forward to working with Smith students again!‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenElections logo\n\n\n\n\nDerek Willis\n‚ÄúThe Smith College students dove right into a complicated and messy set of tasks. They asked good questions and weren‚Äôt shy about making suggestions that improved the outcome. We were looking for a way to turn what was a repetitive manual task into one that could be at least partially automated, and they succeeded at producing code that trades data entry and other time-consuming methods for a better, faster approach. Finally, they were professional in their communication and maintained a positive attitude throughout the project.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\nNBA logo\n\n\n\n\nNBA team analyst\n‚ÄúIt was a pleasure to collaborate with the SDS 410 students. We were impressed by the students‚Äô technical capabilities and their ability to work independently. Their work was both well documented and clearly presented and overall we were very happy with the results they achieved.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin Project logo\n\n\n\n\nMeghan Crimmins\n‚ÄúThe Smith College students we worked with were professional, timely, and were able to explain complex ideas in digestible ways. They communicated well throughout the project and were committed to finding a solution to our data problem. Their use of natural language processing to extract and structure previously unstructured data has helped inform our research on proliferation networks, and the macro-level visualizations they delivered have given us new ways to present our research to potential clients and the public. We look forward to working with Smith SDS students again in the future!‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\nPraava Health logo\n\n\n\n\nSabrina Imam\n‚ÄúTheir work has helped us figure out the entity definitions of a large portion of the database. We found the students to be very enthusiastic, smart, and professional in their approach. They were very quick to understand our database, and were always on time for our weekly calls despite the 10-hour time difference. We especially appreciate the students‚Äô creative thinking and their use of some new and innovative tools to create a column-to-column connectivity diagram and a network graph that was outside the project scope.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\nProPublica logo\n\n\n\n\nRyann Grochowski Jones\n‚ÄúThe SDS 410 students were communicative and professional. They worked independently but weren‚Äôt afraid to ask questions if something was unclear. I‚Äôm eager to work with Smith students again in future semesters.‚Äù"
